In addition to types, literate-ts can also run your code snippets and check the output against whatever you expected. To do this, you need to give your code samples names.

For example:

[[log-numbers]]
[source,ts]
----
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
----

produces the following output:

[[log-numbers-output]]
----
0
1
2
3
4
----

When you run this file through literate-ts, it verifies two things:

1. That the TypeScript sample contains no type errors.
2. That the output (when the compiled JS is run through node) matches the contents of the output block.

The code and output blocks are linked by their names: `log-numbers` and `log-numbers-output`.

This also works for JS code samples.
